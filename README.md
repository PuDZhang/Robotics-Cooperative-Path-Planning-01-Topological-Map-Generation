# Robotics-Path-Planning-Topological-Map-Generation
Python codes for robotics Topological-Map-Generation algorithm.
## What is this?
This is a Python code of Topological-Map-Generation algorithm. This method can generate topological maps in clutter free space. It is divided into three steps.
1. Extract the centerline of the free space.
2. Do the collision checking & width detecting.
3. Generate a topology map.
